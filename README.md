JSDuck for Titanium
===================

This is the Appcelerator fork of JSDuck, which contains several modifications to
support Titanium and Alloy documentation. The [doctools](https://github.com/appcelerator/doctools) 
repo contains related scripts and configuration files for building the docs.

All Appcelerator-related changes to JSDuck are distributed under the same license as
the original JSDuck code -- the GNU General Public License version 3.

See the [main JSDuck repo](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) for much more information on
the JSDuck project.

Thanks to [Rene Saarsoo](http://triin.net), [Nick Poulden](https://github.com/nick),
and everyone else who has contributed to JSDuck.
